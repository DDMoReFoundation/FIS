The pathlist C:\Users\mrogalski\git\PORTABLE.NONMEM\\gfortran\bin\ obtained from file C:\SEE\\nm_7.3.0_g\nmloc.bat is placed at the head of PATH 
The gfortran compiler at one of those locations will be used if it exists. 
If this is not what you want, then modify the file C:\SEE\\nm_7.3.0_g\nmloc.bat accordingly.
