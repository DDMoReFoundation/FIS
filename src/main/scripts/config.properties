# FIS can be configured in either Demonstrator 1.0 "Plan A" mode (MDL is converted to intermediate PharmML and this submitted to MIF)
# or Demonstrator 1.0 "Plan B" mode (MDL is converted directly to NMTRAN (NONMEM) and this submitted to MIF).
# For "Plan A" set this wrapper script filename to "MdlToPharmML.groovy" and for "Plan B" set it to "MdlToNmtran.groovy".
# The scripts themselves live within the "scripts" directory of the delivered bundle.

# Otherwise execution.host.fileshare must point to a directory within a virtual filesystem mapped from the remote host,
# and execution.host.fileshare.remote must point to that directory on the remote host.
